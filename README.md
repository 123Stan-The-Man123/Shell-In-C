# This is bsh, the Basic Shell!
I am writing this shell completely for fun, as a way to practice and learn C while reading "The C Programming Language" by Kernighan and Richie. For now, it can handle most simple commands, and that's about it. Maybe in the future I will expand on it with features like piping, background processes (that work), $PATH variables, etc.

## Features
* Command parsing
* cd and exit built-in commands (more to come!)
* External command execution
* Background process support (buggy)
* Some basic error handling
* Some basic screen management
